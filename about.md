<p>
I am a '27 student at the University of Waterloo for Computer Science. 
Throughout my high school years, I've been very passionate about both math and programming, and as a result, much of my time has been dedicated to preparing for various contests in these fields.
I'm always eager to deepen my understanding of both computer science and math!
